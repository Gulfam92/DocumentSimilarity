# DocumentSimilarity Algorithm
This project is implemented to check the similarity between texts or sentences and provide a similarity score based on how similar the sentences are compared to each other.

## Steps to run the program
1) Run the documentSimilarity.py file in any python editor.
2) After running the file, the terminal will ask to enter Sentence 1, Sentence 2 and Sentence 3 one after other.
3) At the end, the program will poduce the final similarity score between Sentence 1 & Sentence 2 and Sentence 1 & Sentence 3.

##### The below sample sentences could be used to run the program and check the final similarity scores for the sample sentences.<br>

We are always looking for opportunities for you to earn more points, which is why we also give you a selection of Special Offers. These Special Offers are opportunities to earn bonus points on top of the regular points you earn every time you purchase a participating brand. No need to pre-select these offers, we'll give you the points whether or not you knew about the offer. We just think it is easier that way.
